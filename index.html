                <p>Self-learners are individuals who take it upon themselves to acquire knowledge and skills independently, often driven by personal curiosity, ambition, or a genuine desire to grow. They engage in a lifelong pursuit of learning, not limited to formal education but encompassing a wide range of subjects and disciplines.
                <br><br>
                      Self-learners exhibit several distinct traits and practices:
